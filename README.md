# finance-and-coding
This repository is for me to keep track of financial models that I have coded using Python.

As a personal goal, I want to begin with beginner models and slowly move onto more complex models, this will require me to learn more about statistics, finance, and other libraries necessary to create these models.

Disclaimer: These models are not to be used as financial instruments or to persuade the user to invest in stocks, these are just replicated models.
